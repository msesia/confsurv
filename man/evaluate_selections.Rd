\title{Evaluate Screening Rule Against True or Imputed Event Times}
\usage{
evaluate_selections(
  data.test.oracle,
  idx.selected,
  screening_time,
  screening_prob,
  screening_crit
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.test.oracle}{A data frame that must contain a column \code{event_time}, representing the known or imputed event time.}

\item{idx.selected}{Integer vector of row indices indicating selected patients.}

\item{screening_time}{Numeric value representing the time horizon for evaluation.}

\item{screening_prob}{Numeric value between 0 and 1, used as a threshold for the screening rule.}

\item{screening_crit}{Character string; either \code{"low risk"} (expecting high survival) or \code{"high risk"} (expecting low survival).}
}
\value{
A named list with the screening time, rule description, number of patients screened,
observed survival proportion, and whether the result satisfies the conservative screening rule.
}
\description{
Given a set of selected patients, compute the proportion who survive beyond a given time,
and determine whether this satisfies the conservative screening criterion.
